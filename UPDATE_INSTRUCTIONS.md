# Dependency Update Instructions

The project dependencies have been updated in the Cargo.toml file:

1. `lazy_static` updated from "1.4" to "1.4.0" (minor version precision)
2. `maud` updated from "0.25" to "0.26.0"
3. `rocket` updated from "0.5.0-rc.3" to stable "0.5.0"

## Regenerating Cargo.lock

After these updates, you need to regenerate the Cargo.lock file. This can be done by running one of the following commands in the project root:

```bash
cargo build
```

or

```bash
cargo update
```

The `cargo build` command will update the Cargo.lock file and also compile the project to ensure that the updated dependencies work correctly with the existing code.

The `cargo update` command will only update the Cargo.lock file without building the project.

## Potential Breaking Changes

The updated dependencies should be compatible with the existing code, but here are some things to be aware of:

1. The update from Rocket 0.5.0-rc.3 to 0.5.0 (stable) might have some API changes, although they should be minimal since it's a release candidate to stable transition.

2. The update from Maud 0.25 to 0.26.0 might have some templating syntax changes, but the basic functionality used in this project (Markup generation) should remain the same.

If you encounter any issues after updating, please check the changelogs for each dependency:
