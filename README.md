# About

I'm getting married! In preparation for the wedding I figured it'd be a fun project to build my own website for it. This is mostly a learning exercise but I intend to add useful features to it over time.

## Technologies Used

* Rust Programming Language
* Rocket Web Server Framework
* Maud HTML Templating Library
* Bootstrap CSS
